# PrairieLearn CyBot Auto-Grader Image

This repository is the start of a CyBot auto-grader docker image for use with PrairieLearn (as part of my senior design project).

Currently there is very little functionality, beyond the ability to build and the same python script used for the ARM auto-grader. Most of the build should be set up, but before continuing development, you should check.

## Goal

The goal of this image is to create an auto-grader similar to the one used by PrairieLearn for C auto-grading that uses the CyBot emulator built at the end of the spring semester.
